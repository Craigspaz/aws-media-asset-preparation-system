# AWS Media Asset Preparation System

The Media Asset Preparation System (MAPS) facilitates the preparation and movement of media assets across AWS storage mediums such as Amazon S3 and Amazon FSx. Anyone involved in preparing media for post-production workflows can upload and download media, search and filter assets, organize media into folders, preview media in the browser, and move media between Amazon S3 and Amazon FSx in preparation for downstream workflows. MAPS provides a simple user interface that can be accessed from the web browser and includes a set of foundational controls for interacting with the media to ensure the experience is intuitive and not a burden to users. MAPS is meant to address pain points involving uploading content to AWS, media preparation, media movement, permissions, search, filtering, and delivery of content and is not meant to be a replacement for an asset management solution.
